## Connecting LEDs on Breadboard üçûüí°

To connect LEDs on a breadboard, follow these steps:

1. Insert the LEDs into the breadboard, ensuring the longer lead (positive) is on one side and the shorter lead (negative) is on the other side.
2. Connect the positive (longer) lead of each LED to a digital pin on the ESP8266 board (D2, D3, D6, D10).
3. Connect the negative (shorter) lead of each LED to the ground (GND) on the ESP8266 board.

Before uploading the code to the ESP8266 board, make sure you have the Arduino software installed. You can download it from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

# Blynk App Setup üì±

Blynk is a platform that allows you to build IoT applications easily. Follow these steps to set up Blynk with your ESP8266 project:

## Web Interface Setup

1. Go to the [Blynk website](https://blynk.io/) and sign up for an account.
2. Once logged in, create a new project and select the ESP8266 board.
3. Configure the project settings and choose the appropriate connection type (Wi-Fi).
4. Add widgets to the project dashboard to control the LEDs and monitor connectivity.

## Variable Setup

1. Create virtual pins in your Blynk project to communicate with the ESP8266.
2. Assign each LED and connectivity indicator to a specific virtual pin.

## Arduino Code Configuration

1. Open the Arduino code file [`Water_Tank_Monitoring_System.ino`](code/Water_Tank_Monitoring_System/Water_Tank_Monitoring_System.ino) from this repository.
2. Include the Blynk library and configure the Wi-Fi credentials.
3. Initialize Blynk with your authentication token and connect to the Blynk server.
4. Map the virtual pins to the corresponding LEDs and connectivity indicators.
5. Implement functions to handle LED control, monitor connectivity status, and read data from the water level depth detection sensor.

## Mobile App Configuration

1. Download and install the Blynk app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blynk-control-arduino-raspberry/id808760481) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.blynk).
2. Log in to the Blynk app using your account credentials.
3. Open the project created earlier in the web interface.
4. Configure the app interface by adding buttons, sliders, or other widgets to control the LEDs and display water level readings.
5. Create widgets to display the connectivity status of the ESP8266 and water level readings from the sensor.

## Template Setup

1. Create templates on the Blynk web interface for the project dashboard.
2. Customize the templates with the desired layout and functionality, including widgets for controlling LEDs, displaying water level readings, and monitoring connectivity.
3. Save the templates and ensure they are synchronized with the mobile app.

## Running the Project

1. Connect your ESP8266 board to power and ensure it is connected to the Wi-Fi network.
2. Open the Blynk app on your mobile device and navigate to the project dashboard.
3. Use the widgets to control the LEDs, monitor connectivity, and view water level readings.
4. Test different scenarios and functionalities to ensure proper operation.
